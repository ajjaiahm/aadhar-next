# Architecture

## High-Level Flow

1) User interacts with Next.js dashboard UI
2) UI calls Go Auth Gateway APIs (localhost:8080)
3) Auth Gateway optionally calls ML Engine (localhost:8000) for quality/liveness confidence
4) Auth Gateway applies adaptive rules:
   - ALLOW
   - ESCALATE (fallback to alternate auth)
   - BLOCK (fraud suspected)
5) Events are logged for:
   - Explainability
   - Fairness monitoring
   - Ghost scan logic

## Services

### 1) Auth Gateway (Go)
Responsibilities:
- Authentication decision logic
- Fraud detection rules (demo)
- Explainability endpoint (decision + reasons)
- Fairness aggregation by group
- Ghost scan detection (inactive activity)

### 2) ML Engine (Python FastAPI)
Responsibilities:
- Stubs for:
  - liveness
  - quality
  - dedup similarity
- Exposes Swagger docs for API testing

### 3) Dashboard (Next.js + Chart.js)
Responsibilities:
- Provide demo UI
- Visualize explainability reason weights
- Visualize fairness rates
- Run ghost scan + show table
- (Planned) Visualize official datasets

## Privacy Model
- No real Aadhaar numbers
- Virtual IDs (VID) used in demo APIs
- Synthetic records only
- Aggregated official datasets contain no personal identifiers
