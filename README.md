# Aadhaar-NEXT

A privacy-first, adaptive multimodal digital identity prototype
built for the Government of India UIDAI Hackathon.

## Problem
Biometric exclusion, fraud, privacy concerns, and scalability
challenges in large-scale identity systems.

## Solution
Aadhaar-NEXT introduces:
- Adaptive multimodal authentication
- Privacy-by-design (Virtual IDs, tokenization)
- Real-time fraud detection
- Fairness & explainability dashboards
- Synthetic-data-driven development

⚠️ No real Aadhaar data is used. All datasets are synthetic.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- Backend: Golang
- ML: Python + FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
- Security: Tokenization, encrypted templates

## Status
Hackathon MVP (working demo + extensible architecture)
